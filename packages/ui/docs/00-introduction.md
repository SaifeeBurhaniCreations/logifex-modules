# Logifex UI

Logifex UI is a **contract-first UI framework** designed for
applications with **complex behavior**, **permissions**, and
**long-term maintainability**.

It is not a theme library.
It is not a component dump.

Logifex UI focuses on:
- explicit behavior
- predictable composition
- separation of UI and logic
- safe extensibility

If your app has:
- Simple vs Pro users
- permission-based UI
- backend-driven behavior
- long-term evolution

Logifex UI is for you.
